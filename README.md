K4GDW.IdTimer
=============

This is one of my first .Net apps that I made available for
public use.   It's  a  very simple little Windows Forms app
that provides a visual reminder for amateur radio operators
to identify their station every 10 minutes as  required  by
FCC rules part [97.119][1].

It would mostly be useful to new hams.More experienced hams
usually will not need any such remnders.

Changes
-------

* **2.0.0** (current version)
  No real code changes.  Just upgraded the old vs2008 project
  to vs2012 and the .Net framework to 4.5.
